#  Coffee Sales Analysis â€” SQLite + Python

##  Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **SQLite** with **Python** to store, query, and visualize coffee shop sales data.  
The dataset includes multiple coffee products, their prices, quantities sold, and sale dates over a one-month period.

We connect to an SQLite database, run SQL queries to summarize the data, and visualize results using **Matplotlib**.
